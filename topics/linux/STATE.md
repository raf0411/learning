# Learner State

## Demonstrated capabilities

- Basic purposes of `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd` — INDEPENDENT verbal recall.
- Current/parent shorthand (`.` and `..`) — INDEPENDENT after correction.
  Correctly predicted and verified a five-step navigation sequence.
- Relative and absolute navigation — INDEPENDENT in a structured lab. Correctly
  used child, parent/child, and root-anchored paths.
- Previous-directory navigation (`cd -`) — INDEPENDENT in one prediction and
  observation.
- Basic `ls` use (`ls`, `-a`, `-l`, and a path operand) — GUIDED. Correctly
  interpreted hidden entries, long output, file-type characters, and inspection
  of another directory without moving.
- Home shortcut (`~`) — GUIDED. Direct observation corrected the prediction
  `/Users` to the actual home `/Users/raffi`.
- Directory creation with `mkdir` — INDEPENDENT execution in one unscaffolded
  checkpoint. Built the requested `copy-practice` tree with correct relative
  paths; used `-p` safely but unnecessarily on some commands.
- Project-tree verification — GUIDED. Correctly mapped every requested child
  directory to recorded `ls` evidence after the mapping requirement was
  clarified; needed correction for the evidence proving the top-level directory.
- Path nesting versus `mkdir -p` — GUIDED. After repeated correction, identified
  `/` in `beta/gamma` as expressing the relationship and correctly identified
  the missing parent that `-p` would create in a transfer question.
- Basic single-file copying with `cp` — GUIDED. Correctly predicted, executed,
  and verified that the source remains and copies appear at two destinations;
  needed correction to distinguish a containing directory path from the full
  copied-file path, then correctly derived `archive/report.txt` independently.
- Interactive overwrite handling with `cp -i` — GUIDED. Declined and accepted
  replacement of a disposable destination, verified the content after both
  choices, and correctly explained that no prompt is needed when the target
  does not yet exist.
- Recursive directory copying with `cp -R` — GUIDED. Observed that plain `cp`
  rejected a directory, then copied and verified the complete subtree with
  `-R`. Needed correction to append only the source directory's final name when
  the destination directory already exists.
- File renaming and relocation with `mv` — GUIDED. Renamed `draft.txt` to
  `report.txt`, then independently predicted and verified the move to
  `review/report.txt`; confirmed preserved content, disappearance of the old
  path, and an unchanged working directory.
- Interactive replacement with `mv -i` — GUIDED. Correctly predicted and
  observed that declining preserved both paths, while accepting replaced the
  destination and made the old source pathname unavailable. Correctly
  distinguished accepted `mv -i` from accepted `cp -i` by whether the source
  pathname remains.
- Placeholder-file creation with `touch` — GUIDED. Created several empty files
  in one command, verified zero-byte sizes, predicted failure when a parent
  directory was missing, then created the parent and nested file separately.
  Initially predicted that touching an existing file would overwrite it; after
  correction, verified that a nonempty file retained its content and size.

## Points requiring reinforcement

- Treat `.` and `..` as paths relative to the current directory; test this again
  after spacing because the initial model was reversed.
- `mkdir` creates directory entries; it does not change the shell's current
  working directory.
- Compare verification output against every requested branch before declaring a
  structure complete.
- When evaluating whether `mkdir -p` is necessary, account for directories that
  earlier commands in the sequence have already created.
- Include the filename when asked for a file's exact path; a path ending at the
  containing directory does not yet identify the file.
- Interpret every relative path from the actual current working directory. From
  inside `move-practice`, `move-practice/inbox/draft.txt` would incorrectly
  look for a nested `move-practice` directory.
- Filesystem commands such as `cp`, `mkdir`, and `mv` do not move the shell;
  only a directory-changing command such as `cd` changes its working directory.
- Keep option purposes separate: `-i` controls replacement confirmation, while
  `cp -R` enables recursive directory copying.
- When an existing directory is the destination, append only the source item's
  final pathname component, not its entire parent path.
- `touch` primarily updates timestamps. It creates the final file when that
  file is missing, does not create missing parent directories, and does not
  overwrite an existing file's content.
- A reproducible command plan must include its starting-location command and
  the exact requested options. The first `touch` plan assumed the starting
  directory and substituted `ls` for the requested `ls -l`; it needed repeated
  correction before all seven commands were recorded.

## Current learning edge

Complete `labs/2026-10-29-safe-file-removal.md`. Build and inspect its
disposable tree, practice declined and accepted `rm -i` choices, observe that
`rmdir` refuses a nonempty directory, and remove a small tree leaf first. The
worksheet is prepared but unstarted, and `labs/removal-practice` does not yet
exist.
