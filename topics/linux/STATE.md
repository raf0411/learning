# Learner State

## Demonstrated capabilities

- Basic purposes of `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd` — INDEPENDENT verbal recall.
- Current/parent shorthand (`.` and `..`) — INDEPENDENT after correction.
  Correctly predicted and verified a five-step navigation sequence.
- Relative and absolute navigation — INDEPENDENT in a structured lab. Correctly
  used child, parent/child, and root-anchored paths.
- Previous-directory navigation (`cd -`) — INDEPENDENT in one prediction and
  observation.
- Basic `ls` use (`ls`, `-a`, `-l`, and a path operand) — GUIDED. Correctly
  interpreted hidden entries, long output, file-type characters, and inspection
  of another directory without moving.
- Home shortcut (`~`) — GUIDED. Direct observation corrected the prediction
  `/Users` to the actual home `/Users/raffi`.
- Directory creation with `mkdir` — INDEPENDENT execution in one unscaffolded
  checkpoint. Built the requested `copy-practice` tree with correct relative
  paths; used `-p` safely but unnecessarily on some commands.
- Project-tree verification — GUIDED. Correctly mapped every requested child
  directory to recorded `ls` evidence after the mapping requirement was
  clarified; needed correction for the evidence proving the top-level directory.
- Path nesting versus `mkdir -p` — GUIDED. After repeated correction, identified
  `/` in `beta/gamma` as expressing the relationship and correctly identified
  the missing parent that `-p` would create in a transfer question.
- Basic single-file copying with `cp` — GUIDED. Correctly predicted, executed,
  and verified that the source remains and copies appear at two destinations;
  needed correction to distinguish a containing directory path from the full
  copied-file path, then correctly derived `archive/report.txt` independently.

## Points requiring reinforcement

- Treat `.` and `..` as paths relative to the current directory; test this again
  after spacing because the initial model was reversed.
- `mkdir` creates directory entries; it does not change the shell's current
  working directory.
- Compare verification output against every requested branch before declaring a
  structure complete.
- When evaluating whether `mkdir -p` is necessary, account for directories that
  earlier commands in the sequence have already created.
- Include the filename when asked for a file's exact path; a path ending at the
  containing directory does not yet identify the file.

## Current learning edge

Learn safe handling of an existing `cp` destination: inspect both files,
predict the interactive prompt, decline and accept replacement in a disposable
lab, and verify content after each choice. Reuse exact destination-path
resolution without procedural hints.
